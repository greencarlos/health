    <p class="rv">“In the book, <em class="calibre1">The Untethered Soul</em>, Michael Singer takes you step-by-step through the process of Gyana, the Yoga of the Intellect, to the Source. Moreover, he does it with elegant simplicity. Read this book carefully and you will get more than a glimpse of eternity.”</p>

    <p class="rvt">—<strong class="calibre2">Deepak Chopra</strong>, Author, <em class="calibre1">Life After Death: The Burden of Proof</em></p>

    <p class="rv">“In lucid, unadorned prose, Michael Singer delivers the essence of the great spiritual teachings of the Ages. Each chapter of <em class="calibre1">The Untethered Soul</em> is an instructive meditation on the binds of the human condition and how each and every knot can be gracefully untied so that our souls may fly. The accuracy and simplicity of this work is a measure of its pure mastery.”</p>

    <p class="rvt">—<strong class="calibre2">James O’Dea</strong>, President of the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS)</p>

    <p class="rv">“Deep spirituality is within your reach in this book. In it you will find the mirror to see your unconditional, holy Self. If you look for practical spirituality not encumbered by credo and ritual, read this book.”</p>

    <p class="rvt">—<strong class="calibre2">Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi</strong>: coauthor of <em class="calibre1">Jewish With Feeling</em> and <em class="calibre1">From Age-ing To Sage-ing</em></p>

    <p class="rv">“Michael Singer has opened my mind to an entirely new dimension of thought. Through <em class="calibre1">The Untethered Soul</em> I have been challenged both psychologically and intellectually in a new and exciting way. It may take more than one reading and many hours of introspection but <em class="calibre1">The Untethered Soul</em> is a must read for anyone in search of greater understanding of themselves and of the truth.”</p>

    <p class="rvt">—<strong class="calibre2">Louis Chiavacci</strong>, Senior Vice-President, Merrill Lynch, ranked in Barron’s top 15 U.S. Investment Managers</p>

    <p class="rv">“<em class="calibre1">The Untethered Soul</em> is a brilliant treatment of the path of spiritual consciousness. It is clearly and powerfully written. Michael Singer provides a firm step for those on a spiritual journey.”</p>

    <p class="rvt">—<strong class="calibre2">Abdul Aziz Said</strong>, Professor of Peace Studies, Chair of Islamic Peace, American University</p>

    <p class="rv">“This publication has released boundless joy for the hungry souls of the world.”</p>

    <p class="rvt">—<strong class="calibre2">Ma Yoga Shakti Saraswati,</strong> founder of Yogashakti International Mission, recipient of <em class="calibre1">Hinduism Today</em> ‘Hindu of the Year 2000’ award</p>

    <p class="rv">“East is East and West is West, but Michael Singer bridges these two great traditions in a radiant treatise on how to succeed in life from our spiritual quest to our everyday tribulations. Freud said that life was composed of love and work. With great eloquence, wit, and compelling logic, Singer’s brilliant book completes this thought by showing them to be two poles of the same selfless devotion.”</p>

    <p class="rvt">—<strong class="calibre2">Ray Kurzweil</strong>, inventor, National Medal of Technology recipient and author of <em class="calibre1">The Age of Spiritual Machines, The Singularity is Near</em>, and other books</p>

    <p class="rv">“This is a seminal book that quite frankly is in a class by itself. In a simple, yet paradoxically profound way, Michael Singer takes the reader on a journey that begins with consciousness tethered to the ego, and ends having taken us beyond our myopic, contained self-image to a state of inner freedom and liberation. Michael Singer’s book is a priceless gift to all who have futilely searched and yearned for a richer, more meaningful, creative life.”</p>

    <p class="rvt">—<strong class="calibre2">Yogi Amrit Desai</strong>, internationally recognized pioneer of modern yoga</p>
